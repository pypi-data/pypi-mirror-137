This python package is created to be used to compute the area ad volume of 2d and 3d shapes

The main purpose of the package is:
1) To help individual having not to remember the formula of area and volume for ever 2d and 3d shapes
2) To allow people to compute faster directly by feeding the data directly in the package
3) lastly to reduce the human error when calculating the areas and volume of various shapes.

Their are many shapes i have covered in the package to allow every individual compute without restricting the package to only basic shapes

check out the list of shapes i have covered in the package
