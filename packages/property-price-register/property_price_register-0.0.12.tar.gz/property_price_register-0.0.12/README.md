Property Price Register
=======================

Easy way of interacting with property price register. Includes forward geocoding data so you can get cleaned addresses with latitude, longitude and the score of the match. I'm not paying for a forward geocoding service so as I use the free trial I'll update the data.

To enter a debugger with access to all sale data run `make load` (if working from the repo) or `load_property_price_register` if you have installed the package and you will have access to the variable `sales` which contains everything

Installation
------------

`pip install property-price-register`
