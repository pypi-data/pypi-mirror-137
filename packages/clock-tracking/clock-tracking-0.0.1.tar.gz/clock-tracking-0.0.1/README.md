# clock

Simple command-line time tracker based on a simple text file format.

# Introduction

This simple utility uses a text file to store tasks with date/time information. Each time you start working on a task, a new line is created on the file with the current time and a description of the task you are starting to work on.

At the end of the day, or anytime, you can then generate reports and statistics based on the file.

## File structure

The file structure is very simple and can be edited using the script or directly with your favorite text editor.
Here is an example file:

```
[2022-01-01]
10:00 Starting project X +projectX
11:23 Starting documentation of project X +projectX +doc
12:00 [Stop]
[2022-01-02]
08:05 Starting workday, checking emails +office +emails
09:00 Back on documentation +projectX +doc
10:00 [Stop]
```

## Tags and ids

An entry in this file can be associated with tags if you start the tag with a `+` (`+tag`) or ID if you start with a `.` (`.456`). 

Tags allow for powerful filtering and reporting. They are ordered, meaning that `+project +doc` is different from `+doc +project` (see reports and filters below).

IDs allow to track time of tasks from an external tool, such as Jira. Entries with an ID are automatically assigned a default tag (`+jira`).

## Special tasks

The `[Stop]` task is used to stop the last task. It is not required if you switch tasks without taking a break.

# Installation

The program is available as a python packge through Pypi, so you can download it using pip:

```
python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ clock-tracking-computoms
```

# Usage

## Tracking tasks

Using the `clock_tracking` python package to run the program, i.e. `python -m clock_tracking`. 

You can add a new entry by adding the entry definition after the package name:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking Definition of the prototype +myapp +proto
Added: 08:10 Definition of the prototype +myapp +proto

Duration   Date                  Start      Stop       Tags            Name                               IDs
00:00      2022-01-01            08:10      08:10      +myapp,+proto   Definition of the prototype         
```

To switch to a new task, just use the same command:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking Switching to new task
Added: 09:02 Switching to a new task

Duration   Date                  Start      Stop       Tags            Name                               IDs
00:00      2022-01-01            08:10      08:10                      Switching to a new task
```

This will automatically stop the last task and start a new one. When you have finished working, use the `stop` command:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking stop
Added: 10:00 [Stop]
```

## Reports

You can show reports/statistics with the `show` command:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking show
```

All tasks are ordered by first tag by default. Several filters are available, see `./clock --help` for the full documentation.

To show all the tasks with their details:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking show --details
```

To filter by a tag:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking show +tag
```

To filter by an ID:

```
$ python -m clock_tracking show .345
```
