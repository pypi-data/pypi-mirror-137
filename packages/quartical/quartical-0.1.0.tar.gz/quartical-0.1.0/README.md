# QuartiCal

QuartiCal is the successor to CubiCal. It implements a suite of fast radio interferometric calibration routines exploiting complex optimisation. Unlike CubiCal, QuartiCal allows for any available Jones terms to be combined. It can also be deployed on a cluster (more information to follow).

## Installation

QuartiCal can be installed using pip: `pip install quartical`.

## Documentation

Documentation is available on [readthedocs](http://quartical.readthedocs.io).
