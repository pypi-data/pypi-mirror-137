A messaging service such as Rabbit is used to transit events.

#### Changelog:

##### 28/11/2021
- Now, by default, new topic aren't announced in new_event_topic_created/event_store.
To announce, you must specify announce_new_topic=True on TbWorker declaration, like that: `w = TbWorker("example_worker_1", announce_new_topic=True)`
- Now you can declare a prefix to Rabbit Exchange names creating an environment variable: `export RBMQ_PREFIX="my_prefix/"`
