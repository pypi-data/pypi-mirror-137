Logger
===================

* 2 types: **summarized logger**, **time logger**
    * for each logger, there is the possebility, to log the summarized kpi over the complete production time or every x seconds (time intervall)
        * the results of the time intervalls, where saved in an extra sub folder
* for each type, each instance is logged and also an average of the instances is calculated

**important:** 
Only tasks with the logging type: "logging" are considered

the kpi's are based on:

* A Hierarchical structure of key performance indicators for operation management and continuous improvement in production systems
