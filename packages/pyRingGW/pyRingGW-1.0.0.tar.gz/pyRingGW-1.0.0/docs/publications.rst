- Methods:

   The code is mainly based on the formalism described in `Carullo et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07527>`_.
   For signals extending below a pure ringdown emission, it uses the truncated formulation of `Isi et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00869>`_ (see also `their longer follow-up <https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05609>`_).   
   Additional details on the methodology and results for GWTC-2 events can be found in the `GWTC-2 Testing GR LVK catalog <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14529>`_.
