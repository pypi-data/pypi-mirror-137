<h4>Sequence search</h4>
<p>
If you want to model an RNA sequence, search for potential templates in <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/search/advanced">PDB</a> and/or <a href="https://rfam.xfam.org/search#tabview=tab1">RFAM</a>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
  The <b>Protein Data Bank (PDB)</b> is a database for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. The data, typically obtained by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, or, increasingly, cryo-electron microscopy, and submitted by biologists and biochemists from around the world, are freely accessible.

</p>
<p>
  The <b>Rfam database</b> is a collection of RNA families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments, consensus secondary structures and covariance models  <a href="https://docs.rfam.org/en/latest/about-rfam.html">more</a>

<h3>RNA 3D structures comparison</h3>

<a href="/tools/diffpdb/{{ ids.11 }}"><b>diffpdb</b></a> it is a simple tool to compare two files of PDB format to identify the difference in the annotation of atoms, missing atoms, missing fragments<br>

<a href="/tools/calc-rmsd/{{ ids.12 }}"><b>Calculate Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)</b></a>
RMSD is the measure of the average distance between the atoms of superimposed RNAs (also proteins etc.). This is a simple, geometrical measure.<br>

<a href="/tools/calc-inf/{{ ids.13 }}"><b>Calculate Network Interaction Fidelity (INF)</b></a>
INF is the measure specific for RNA molecules. RNAs are represented by network of interactions, and the closes two networks of interactions of two molecules are similar, the higher INF.<br>
