<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
  This server is an implementation of some methods from <a href="https://github.com/mmagnus/rna-tools">rna-tools</a>.
</p>
<p>
  rna-tools includes a set of tools dedicated to (1) RNA structural handling and manipulating, i.e. rebuilding missing atoms, (2) structure clustering, (3) standardization of RNA structures, (4 visualization of secondary RNA structures, i.e. drawing RNA arc diagrams of secondary structure, (5) visualization of RNA sequence alignments, and more.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Significant improvements have been made in the efficiency and accuracy of RNA 3D structure prediction methods in recent years; however, many tools developed in the field stay exclusive to only a few bioinformatic groups. To perform a complete RNA 3D structure modeling analysis as proposed in the RNA-Puzzles publications, e.g., [1], the researchers must familiarize themselves with a quite complex set of tools.
</p>
<p>
The goal of the rna-tools package [2] was to provide a more abstract way to process data for RNA 3D modeling. Nowadays, rna-tools has become a wide toolbox to approach every aspect of working with various types of RNA data. The package was used to provide computational resources for the RNA-puzzle community [2] and also offered tools for other biological applications, e.g., [3,4,5].
</p>
However, using rna-tools requires the installation of a mixture of library and tools and basic knowledge of the Linux terminal command line. To give a chance for all biologists to take advantage of developments in RNA 3D structure prediction, we provide a user-friendly server to perform many standard analyses required to the typical modeling workflow: secondary structure prediction, 3D structure manipulating and editing, structure minimization, structures analysis and comparison tools.
<p>
  In the server, each tool has been translated into a web application. The user can use the web browser, selecting the tool to use and uploading its own files. Once the computation is done, the webserver allows the user to download the results and explore the steps that were used to perform the analysis. This will also provide a way to learn how the rna-tool package can be used and will spur the user into trying to perform more customized analyses.
</p>
<p>
All tools are well documented and the examples are provided to help the users to understand the tools.
