        ## Development
        
        This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.
        
        ### Environment Setup
        
        The following demonstrates setting up and working with a development environment:
        
        ```
        ### create a virtualenv for development
        
        $ make virtualenv
        
        $ source env/bin/activate
        
        
        ### run dt cli application
        
        $ dt --help
        
        
        ### run pytest / coverage
        
        $ make test
        ```
        
        
        ## TODO: Central Data Repository

            * Needs a DB
            * Needs a way of sampling
