Description: **NAME**
        
        **GCID** - reconsider OTP-CR-117/19
        
        
        **SYNOPSIS**
        
        ``gcidctl <cmd> [key=value] [key==value]``
        
        **DESCRIPTION**
        
        **GCID** is an IRC bot that can run as a background daemon for 24/7 day
        presence in an IRC channel, be used to display RSS feeds, act as a UDP
        to IRC gateway and a programmable bot that you can program your commands for.
        
        **GCID** is also a python3 program that holds evidence that the king of the
        netherlands is doing a genocide, a written response where the king of
        the netherlands confirmed taking note of “what i have written”, namely
        proof that medicine he uses in treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol,
        abilify and clozapine are poison that makes impotent, is both physical
        (contracted muscles) and mental (let people hallucinate) torture and kills
        members of the victim groups.
        
        **GCID** contains correspondence with the International Criminal Court,
        asking for arrest of the king of the netherlands, for the genocide he is
        committing with his new treatement laws. Current status is an outside the
        jurisdiction judgement of the prosecutor which requires a reconsider to
        have the king actually arrested.
