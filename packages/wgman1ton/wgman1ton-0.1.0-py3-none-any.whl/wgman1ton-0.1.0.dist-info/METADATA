# 1toN-wireguard-manager

Simple cli-tool to create the wg0.conf-files for a 1-to-many network infrastructure in which the N-peers can connect to each other via the 1-peer.

Note that the keys are stored in an unencrypted sqlite-file and the configs get exported as plain text files â€“ use this on your own risk!

# installation

    pip install wgman1ton

You also need wireguard installed (the package is called wireguard-tools in many distributions).

# usage

    $ wgman1ton

The software will create a database file called wgman1ton.db to persist the configuration.

Navigate through the cli-menu. In the end export the configuration and distribute it to the appropriate peers.

Call the software from the same directory later to continue where you left off.
