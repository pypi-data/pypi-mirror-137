The system is built around quickly **analyzing the whole dataset** and **providing a detailed report with visualization**. Its goal is to help quick analysis of feature characteristics, detecting outliers from the observations and other such data characterization tasks.\n## Features\n1. `plot_histograms`: Plots the distribution for numerical, categorical and text features\n2. `detect_outliers`: Generate a violin plot that indicates the outliers that deviate from other observations on data.\n3. `plot_corr`: Generates Correlation Plots for numerical (Pearson\'s correlation), categorical (uncertainty coefficient) and categorical-numerical (correlation ratio) datatypes seamlessly for all data types.\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ pip install snapedautility\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### plot_histograms\n```\n>>> from snapedautility.plot_histograms import plot_histograms\n>>> df = penguins_data\n>>> plot_histograms(df, ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", \'Species\'], 100, 100)\n```\n\n### plot_corr\n```\n>>> from snapedautility.plot_corr import plot_corr\n>>> df = penguins_data\n>>> plot_corr(df, ["Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", \'Species\'])\n```\n\n### detect_outliers\n```\n>>> from snapedautility.detect_outliers import detect_outliers \n>>> s = pd.Series([1,1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,13,40])\n>>> detect_outliers(s)\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe official documentation is hosted on Read the Docs: https://snapedautility.readthedocs.io/\n\n## Contributors\n\n|  \t Core contributor| Github.com username| \n|---------|---|\n|  Kyle Ahn |  @AraiYuno | \n|  Harry Chan |  @harryyikhchan | \n|  Dongxiao Li | @dol23asuka | \n\nInterested in contributing?

Our package aims to do a few things very well, and be light weight. A non exhaustive list of EDA helper packages in Python include:\n\n- [`pandasprofiling`](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)\n    - This was the original inspiration for this project. We would like to expand the functionalities on this project.\n- [`sweetviz`](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz)\n    - This package produces very clean visuals detailing breakdowns in descriptive statistics and can do so with train/test sets for model building workflows.\n- [`ExploriPy`](https://github.com/exploripy/exploripy)\n    - This packages does the most common EDA tasks but also adds in the ability to do statistical testing using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Chi Square test of independence etc.\n\n## License\n\n`snapedautility` was created by Kyle Ahn, Harry Chan and Dongxiao Li. It is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\n\n## Credits\n\n`snapedautility` was created with [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the `py-pkgs-cookiecutter` [template](https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter).\n',
