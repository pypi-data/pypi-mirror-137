Description: # File exclude plugin for docums
        
        `docums-exclude` is a
        [docums plugin](http://khanhduy1407.github.io/docums/user-guide/plugins/) that allows you
        to exclude files from your input using unix-style wildcards (globs) or
        regular expressions (regexes).
        
        
        ## Quick start
        
        1. Install the module using pip: `pip3 install docums-exclude`
        
        2. In your project, add a plugin configuration to `docums.yml`:
        
           ```yaml
           plugins:
             - exclude:
                 glob:
                   - exclude/this/path/*
                   - "*.tmp"
                   - "*.pdf"
                   - "*.gz"
                 regex:
                   - '.*\.(tmp|bin|tar)$'
           ```
        
        You can provide zero or more patterns of each type.  (If you don't provide
        any patterns, then nothing will happen!)
        
        Note!  Because of peculiarity of yaml syntax, the `glob:` and `regex:` lines
        **must not** start with a dash, but the lines under them **must** start with
        a dash.
        
        Also because of yaml, patterns that start with a punctuation mark must be
        quoted.
        
        When writing regexes, it's best to use single quotes rather than double
        quotes, so that your regex backslash escapes are preserved correctly without
        having to be doubled up.
