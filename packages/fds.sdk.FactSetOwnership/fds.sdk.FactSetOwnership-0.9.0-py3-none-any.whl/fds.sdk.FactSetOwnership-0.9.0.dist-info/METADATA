    FactSetâ€™s Fund Ownership API gives access to both **Holdings** and **Holders** data.&lt;p&gt; Factset&#39;s Holdings endpoints gives access to all the underlying securities and their position detils held within a given fund. Fund Types supported include Open-End Mutual Funds, Closed-end Mutual Funds, and Exchange Traded Funds. Security Holders information retrieves all \&quot;holder types\&quot; and their positions across institutions, funds, insiders, and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FactSet Ownership and Mutual Funds database collects global equity ownership data for approximately 50,000 institutions, 60,000 unique Mutual Fund portfolios, and 400,000 Insider/Stake holders from around 110 countries.
