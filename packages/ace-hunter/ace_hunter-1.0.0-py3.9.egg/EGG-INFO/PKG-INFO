Description: # ace-hunter
        
        `ace-hunter` is primarily a command line tool for performing hunt validation in ACE environments. It's derived directly from the ACE Hunting System and can serve has a drop in replacement with some small changes to the ACE Hunting System.
        
        Splunk hunts are the only hunts currently supported.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        ```
        pip install ace_hunter
        ``` 
        
        You could also git clone this repo and `python3 setup.py install` inside whatever python environment you with. *NOTE*: I've only tested this in python3.9 but it should work for python>=3.6.
        
        
        ## CLI Tool
        
        A tool called `hunt` is made available on the command line after install.
        
        ```console
        $ hunt -h
        usage: hunt [-h] [-d] {list-types,lt,list,l,verify,v,execute,config} ...
        
        A hunting tool for ACE ecosystems.
        
        positional arguments:
          {list-types,lt,list,l,verify,v,execute,config}
            list-types (lt)     List the types of Hunts configured.
            list (l)            List the available hunts. The format of the output is E|D type:name - description E: enabled D: disabled
            verify (v)          Verifies that all configured hunts are able to load.
            execute             Execute a hunt with the given parameters.
            config              Configure and query the Hunter configuration.
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -d, --debug           Turn on debug logging.
        ```
        
        ## Configure
        
        You need to configure ace-hunter to work with your Splunk environment, your splunk hunt rules, and optionally your ACE environment.
        
        ## TODO
        
          -  [ ] Allow proxy settings to be configurable for flexibility. Use use environment variables as needed for now.
