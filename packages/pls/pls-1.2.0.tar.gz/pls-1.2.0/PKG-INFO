`pls` is a better `ls` for developers. The "p" stands for "pro" as in "professional" or "programmer".

It works in a manner similar to `ls`, in  that it lists directories and files in a given directory, but it adds many more developer-friendly features.

Note that `pls` is not a replacement for `ls`. `ls` is a tried, tested and trusted tool with lots of features. `pls`, on the other hand, is a simple tool for people who just want to see the contents of their directories.

## Features

`pls` provides many features over  `ls` command. `pls` can:

- show Nerd Font icons or emoji next to files and directories making it easier to grep the output
- colour output to further distinguish important files
- use a more nuanced approach to hidden files than plainly hiding files with a leading dot `.`
- groups directories and shows them all before files
- ignores leading dots `.` in sorting files

The icon, color and most behaviour in the application can be configured using plain-text YAML files for the pros who prefer to tweak their tools.

## Upcoming features

In the future `pls` will be able to

- generate visibility rules by parsing `.gitingore`
- add MIME type as another method for matching files to specs
- use complete path based matching for files
- cascade specs based on specificity levels
- provide channels to extend specs per user, per project
- link files and hide derived files behind the main ones
- support more columns like permissions, owner and size
- support for tree-like output

If you want to help implement any of these features, feel free to submit a PR. `pls` is free and open-source software.
