The "p" stands for "pro" as in "professional" or "programmer".\n\nIt works in a manner similar to `ls`, in  that it lists directories and files in a given directory, but it adds many more developer-friendly features.\n\nNote that `pls` is not a replacement for `ls`. `ls` is a tried, tested and trusted tool with lots of features. `pls`, on the other hand, is a simple tool for people who just want to see the contents of their directories.\n\n## Features\n\n`pls` provides many features over  `ls` command. `pls` can:\n\n- show Nerd Font icons or emoji next to files and directories making it easier to grep the output\n- colour output to further distinguish important files\n- use a more nuanced approach to hidden files than plainly hiding files with a leading dot `.`\n- groups directories and shows them all before files\n- ignores leading dots `.` and normalises case when sorting files\n- cascade specs by based on specificity levels\n- read `.pls.yml` files from the directory to augment its configuration\n\nThe icon, color and most behaviour in the application can be configured using plain-text YAML files for the pros who prefer to tweak their tools.\n\n## Upcoming features\n\nIn the future `pls` will be able to\n\n- generate visibility rules by parsing `.gitingore`\n- add MIME type as another method for matching files to specs\n- use complete path based matching for files\n- link files and hide derived files behind the main ones\n- support more columns like permissions, owner and size\n- support for tree-like output\n\nIf you want to help implement any of these features, feel free to submit a PR. `pls` is free and open-source software.\n',
