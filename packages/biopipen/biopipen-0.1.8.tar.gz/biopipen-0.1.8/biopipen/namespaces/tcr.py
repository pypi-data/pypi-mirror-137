    """Immuarch - Loading data

    Build based on immunarch 0.6.7
    See https://immunarch.com/articles/v2_data.html for supported data formats
    Currently only 10x data format is supported

    Library `dplyr` is also required to manipulate the meta data.

    Input:
        metafile: The meta data of the samples
            A tab-delimited file
            Two columns are required:
            - `Sample` to specify the sample names.
            - `TCRDir` to assign the path of the data to the samples,
            and this column will be excluded as metadata.
            Immunarch is able to fetch the sample names from the names of
            the target files. However, 10x data yields result like
            `filtered_contig_annotations.csv`, which doesn't have any name
            information.

    Output:
        rdsfile: The RDS file with the data and metadata

    Envs:
        tmpdir: The temporary directory to link all data files.

    Input:
        immdata: The data loaded by `immunarch::repLoad()`
        filterfile: A config file in TOML.
            A dict of configurations with keys as the names of the group and
            values dicts with following keys.
            See `envs.filters`


    Output:
        outfile: The filtered `immdata`
        groupfile: Also a group file with first column the groups and other
            columns the cell barcodes in the samples

    Envs:
        merge: Merge the cells from the samples, instead of list cells
            for different samples. The cell ids will be preficed with the sample
            name, connected with `_`. The column name will be `ALL` instead.
        clonotype: Use clonotype (CDR3.aa) as the group. The name from
            `envs.filters` will be ignored
        filters: The filters to filter the data
            You can have multiple cases (groups), the names will be the keys of
            this dict, values are also dicts with keys the methods supported by
            `immunarch::repFilter()`.
            There is one more method `by.count` supported to filter the
            count matrix. For `by.meta`, `by.repertoire`, `by.rep`,
            `by.clonotype` or `by.col` the values will be passed to
            `.query` of `repFilter()`.
            You can also use the helper functions provided by `immunarch`,
            including `morethan`, `lessthan`, `include`, `exclude` and
            `interval`. If these functions are not used, `include(value)` will
            be used by default.
            For `by.count`, the value of `filter` will be passed to
            `dplyr::filter()` to filter the count matrix.
            You can also specify `ORDER` to define the filtration order, which
            defaults to 0, higher `ORDER` gets later executed.
            For example:
            >>> {{
            >>>   "Top20BM_Post": {{
            >>>     "by.meta": {{"Source": "BM", "Status": "Post"}},

            all samples will be used
            Other than the target supported by immunarch, you can also specify

            `tracking_target = {{ "top_4": {{"TOP": 4}} }}`
        kmers: Arguments for kmer analysis.
            Keys are the K of mers. Values are parameters:
            - `head` specifies # of the most abundant kmers to visualise.
            - `position`: positions of bars: `stack`, `dodge` and `fill`
            - `log`: log-transformation of y-axis
            - `motif`: Method for motif analysis
            There can be multiple `head`s and `motif`s.
            If you do want multiple parameter sets for the same K, You can use
            a float number as the K. For example: `5.1` for K `5`.
