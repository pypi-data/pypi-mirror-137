`covizpy` is a Python package that provides easy access to Covid-19 data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), as well as functions to generate relevant Covid-19 charts and summaries easily. We aim to make `covizpy` simple and easy to use. Our goal is to enable anyone with basic Python programming knowledge to access and visualize Covid-19 data, and make their own informed decisions and conclusions.

There are existing Python packages that allow users to download and generate Covid-19 charts. For example, [covid19pandas](https://github.com/PayneLab/covid19pandas) is a package that presents COVID-19 data from Johns Hopkins University and The New York Times in pandas dataframes, to make analysis and visualization easier in a Python environment.

While other packages have more advanced plotting capabilities, we provide simpler functions that allow users to answer questions regarding the Covid-19 pandemic as quickly as possible.

## Features

This package contains four functions: `plot_metric`, `plot_spec`, `get_data` and `plot_summary`.

* `plot_metric`: Create a line chart presenting COVID total new cases versus another metric within a time period

* `plot_spec`: Create a line chart presenting specific country/countries COVID information within a time period

* `get_data`: User can retrieve the COVID data from the source as a pandas dataframe. Specific data can be retrieved by passing the date range and the list of countries

* `plot_summary`: Create a horizontal bar chart summarising a specified variable and value within a time period

## Dependencies

Before installing the package, following packages must be installed:

- python = "^3.9"
- pandas = "^1.3.5"
- altair = "^4.2.0"
- altair-saver = "^0.5.0"

## Installation

```bash
pip install covizpy
```

## Usage and Examples 

To use the package, import the package with following commands:

```python
from covizpy.get_data import get_data
from covizpy.plot_summary import plot_summary
from covizpy.plot_metric import plot_metric
from covizpy.plot_spec import plot_spec
```

To use the functions, see below examples:

### Retrieve COVID-19 data with specified date range and default all locations

```python
df = get_data(date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-21")
```

### Plot summary graph (bar chart)

```python
plot_summary(df, var="location", val="new_cases", fun="sum", date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-15", top_n=10)
```

### Plot COVID-19 cases for specific countries (line chart)

```python
plot_spec(df, location=["Canada", "Turkey"], val="new_cases", date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-07")
```

### Plot new COVID-19 cases versus another metric (line chart)

```python
plot_metric(location="Canada", metric="positive_rate", date_from="2022-01-01", date_to="2022-01-15")
```
