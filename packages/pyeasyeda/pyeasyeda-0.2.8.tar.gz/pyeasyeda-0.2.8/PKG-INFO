Since exploratory data analysis is an imperative part of every analysis, this package aims at providing efficient data scrubbing and visualization tools to perform preliminary EDA on raw data. The package can be leveraged to clean the dataset and visualize relationships between features to generate insightful trends.

## Functions

-   `clean_up` - This function takes in a pandas dataframe object and performs initial steps of EDA on unstructured data. It returns a clean dataset by removing null values and identifying potential outliers in numeric variables based on a defined threshold.

-   `birds_eye_view` - This function takes in a pandas dataframe object and visualizes the distributions of variables in the form of histograms and density plots. It also generates a correlation heatmap for numeric variables to study their relationships.

-   `close_up` - This function accepts a pandas dataframe object creates a scatterplot of the variable(s) most strongly correlated with the dependent variable. The plot also produces a trend line to model the correlation between the variables.

-   `summary_suggestions` - This function takes in a pandas dataframe object and outputs a table of summary statistics for numeric and categorical variables and a table for percentage of unique values in the categorical variables.

Other packages that offer similar functionality are:
- [datascience_eda](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datascience_eda)
- [QuickDA](https://github.com/sid-the-coder/QuickDA)
- [easy-data-analysis](https://github.com/jschnab/easy-data-analysis)

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install pyeasyeda
```

## Usage
After installing the package through the command above, please run the following commands in the terminal from the root of the project repo as a quick demo. 
```
python
import pandas as pd
from pyeasyeda.clean_up import clean_up
from pyeasyeda.birds_eye_view import birds_eye_view
from pyeasyeda.close_up import close_up
from pyeasyeda.summary_suggestions import summary_suggestions
df = pd.read_csv("tests/data/penguins_test.csv")
clean_up(df)
plots = birds_eye_view(df)
close_up(df, 1)
summary_suggestions(df)

```
