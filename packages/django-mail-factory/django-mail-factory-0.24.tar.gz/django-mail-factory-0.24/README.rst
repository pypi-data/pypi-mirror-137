Hacking
=======

Setup your environment:

::

    git clone https://github.com/peopledoc/django-mail-factory.git
    cd django-mail-factory

Hack and run the tests using `Tox <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_ to test
on all the supported python and Django versions:

::

    make test

If you want to give a look at the demo (also used for the tests):

::

    bin/python demo/manage.py syncdb  # create an administrator
    bin/python demo/manage.py runserver

You then need to login on http://localhost:8000/admin, and the email
administration (preview or render) is available at
http://localhost:8000/mail_factory/.


Release
=======

To prepare a new version:

* Create a branch named ``release/<version>``
* In a commit, change the ``CHANGELOG`` and ``VERSION`` file to remove the ``.dev0`` and set the date of the release
* In a second commit, change the ``VERSION`` to the next version number + ``.dev0``
* Create a PR for your branch
* When the PR is merged, tag the first commit with the version number, and create a github release using the ``CHANGELOG``

To release a new version (including the wheel)::

    pip install twine
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

And after testing everything works fine on the testing repository::

    twine upload dist/*
