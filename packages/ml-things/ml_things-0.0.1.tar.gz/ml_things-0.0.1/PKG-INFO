        **Machine Learning Things** is a lightweight python library that contains functions and code snippets that 
        I use in my everyday research with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP.
        
        I created this repo because I was tired of always looking up same code from older projects and I wanted to gain some experience in building a Python library. 
        By making this available to everyone it gives me easy access to code I use frequently and it can help others in their machine learning work. 
        If you find any bugs or something doesn't make sense please feel free to open an issue.
        
        That is not all! This library also contains Python code snippets and notebooks that speed up my Machine Learning workflow.
        
         **Note:** 
         * <s> *If I reach 100 stars I will release the first official version and add it to the pip install modules!* </s>
         * **Update:** `July 16, 2021` Thank you all for your support and kidness! As I promissed I will move this repo to pip install modules.

        # ML_things
        
        ## Installation
        
        This repo is tested with Python 3.6+.
        
        It's always good practice to install `ml_things` in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you guidance on using Python's virtual environments you can check out the user guide [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).
        
        You can install `ml_things` with pip from GitHub:
        
        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things
        ```
        
        ## Functions
        
        All function implemented in the **ml_things** module.
        
        ### Array Functions
        
        Array manipulation related function that can be useful when working with machine learning.
        
        #### pad_array [[source]](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/src/ml_things/array_functions.py#L21)
        
        Pad variable length array to a fixed numpy array. It can handle single arrays [1,2,3] or nested arrays [[1,2],[3]].
            
        By default it will padd zeros to the maximum length of row detected:
        
        ```python
        >>> from ml_things import pad_array
        >>> pad_array(variable_length_array=[[1,2],[3],[4,5,6]])
        array([[1., 2., 0.],
               [3., 0., 0.],
               [4., 5., 6.]])
        ```
        
        It can also pad to a custom size and with cusotm values:
        
        ```python
        >>> pad_array(variable_length_array=[[1,2],[3],[4,5,6]], fixed_length=5, pad_value=99)
        array([[ 1.,  2., 99., 99., 99.],
               [ 3., 99., 99., 99., 99.],
               [ 4.,  5.,  6., 99., 99.]])
        ```
               
        #### batch_array [[source]](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/src/ml_things/array_functions.py#L120)
        
        Split a list into batches/chunks. Last batch size is remaining of list values.
        **Note:** *This is also called chunking. I call it batches since I use it more in ML.*
        
        The last batch will be the reamining values:
        
        ```python
        >>> from ml_things import batch_array
        >>> batch_array(list_values=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,9,8,6,5,4,6], batch_size=4)
        [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 9, 8, 6], [5, 4, 6]]
        ```
        
        ### Plot Functions
        
        Plot related function that can be useful when working with machine learning.
        
        
        #### plot_array [[source]](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/src/ml_things/plot_functions.py#L29)
        
        Create plot from a single array of values.
        
        All arguments are optimized for quick plots. Change the `magnify` arguments to vary the size of the plot:
        
        ```python
        >>> from ml_things import plot_array
        >>> plot_array([1,3,5,3,7,5,8,10], path='plot_array.png', magnify=0.1, use_title='A Random Plot', start_step=0.3, step_size=0.1, points_values=True, use_ylabel='Thid', use_xlabel='This')
        ```
        
        ![plot_array](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/tests/test_samples/plot_array.png)
        
        
        #### plot_dict [[source]](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/src/ml_things/plot_functions.py#L275)
        
        Create plot from a single array of values.
        
        All arguments are optimized for quick plots. Change the `magnify` arguments to vary the size of the plot:
        
        ```python
        >>> from ml_things import plot_dict
        >>> plot_dict({'train_acc':[1,3,5,3,7,5,8,10],
                        'valid_acc':[4,8,9]}, use_linestyles=['-', '--'], magnify=0.1, 
                        start_step=0.3, step_size=0.1,path='plot_dict.png', points_values=[True, False], use_title='Title')
        ```
        
        ![plot_dict](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/tests/test_samples/plot_dict.png)
        
        
        #### plot_confusion_matrix [[source]](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/src/ml_things/plot_functions.py#L529)
        
        This function prints and plots the confusion matrix. Normalization can be applied by setting `normalize=True`.
        
        All arguments are optimized for quick plots. Change the `magnify` arguments to vary the size of the plot:
        
        ```python
        >>> from ml_things import plot_confusion_matrix
        >>> plot_confusion_matrix(y_true=[1,0,1,1,0,1], y_pred=[0,1,1,1,0,1], magnify=0.1, use_title='My Confusion Matrix', path='plot_confusion_matrix.png');
        Confusion matrix, without normalization
        array([[1, 1],
               [1, 3]])
        ```
        
        ![plot_confusion_matrix](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/blob/master/tests/test_samples/plot_confusion_matrix.png)
        
        ### Text Functions
        
        Text related function that can be useful when working with machine learning.

        Clean text using various techniques:
        
        ```python
        >>> from ml_things import clean_text
        >>> clean_text("ThIs is $$$%.  \t\t\n \\ so dirtyyy$$ text :'(.   omg!!!", full_clean=True)
        'this is so dirtyyy text omg'
        ```
        
        ### Web Related

        # Snippets
        
        This is a very large variety of Python snippets without a certain theme. I put them in the most frequently used ones while keeping a logical order.
        I like to have them as simple and as efficient as possible.

        # Comments
        
        These are a few snippets of how I like to comment my code. I saw a lot of different ways of how people comment their code. One thing is for sure: *any comment is better than no comment*.
        
        I try to follow as much as I can the [PEP 8 — the Style Guide for Python Code](https://pep8.org/#code-lay-out).
        
        When I comment a function or class:
        ```python
        # required import for variables type declaration
        from typing import List, Optional, Tuple, Dict
        
        def my_function(function_argument: str, another_argument: Optional[List[int]] = None,
                        another_argument_: bool = True) -> Dict[str, int]
               r"""Function/Class main comment. 
        
               More details with enough spacing to make it easy to follow.
        
               Arguments:
               
                      function_argument (:obj:`str`):
                             A function argument description.
                             
                      another_argument (:obj:`List[int]`, `optional`):
                             This argument is optional and it will have a None value attributed inside the function.
                             
                      another_argument_ (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`True`):
                             This argument is optional and it has a default value.
                             The variable name has `_` to avoid conflict with similar name.
                             
               Returns:
               
                      :obj:`Dict[str: int]`: The function returns a dicitonary with string keys and int values.
                             A class will not have a return of course.
        
               """
               
               # make sure we keep out promise and return the variable type we described.
               return {'argument': function_argument}
        ```

        # Notebooks Tutorials
        
        This is where I keep notebooks of some previous projects which I turnned them into small tutorials. A lot of times I use them as basis for starting a new project.
        
        All of the notebooks are in **Google Colab**. Never heard of Google Colab? :scream_cat: You have to check out the [Overview of Colaboratory](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiD1aD06trrAhVRXK0KHRC4DgQQjBAwBHoECAYQBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2Fnotebooks%2Fbasic_features_overview.ipynb&usg=AOvVaw0gXOkR6JGGFlwsxrkuYm7F), [Introduction to Colab and Python](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiD1aD06trrAhVRXK0KHRC4DgQQjBAwA3oECAYQCg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2Fgithub%2Ftensorflow%2Fexamples%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fcourses%2Fudacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning%2Fl01c01_introduction_to_colab_and_python.ipynb&usg=AOvVaw2pr-crqP30RHfDs7hjKNnc) and what I think is a great medium article about it [to configure Google Colab Like a Pro](https://medium.com/@robertbracco1/configuring-google-colab-like-a-pro-d61c253f7573).
        
        If you check the `/ml_things/notebooks/` a lot of them are not listed here because they are not in a 'polished' form yet. These are the notebooks that are good enough to share with everyone:

        # Final Note
        
        Thank you for checking out my repo. I am a perfectionist so I will do a lot of changes when it comes to small details. 
        
        If you see something wrong please let me know by opening an 
        **[issue on my ml_things](https://github.com/gmihaila/ml_things/issues/new/choose)** GitHub repository! 
        
        A lot of tutorials out there are mostly a one-time thing and are not being maintained. I plan on keeping my 
        tutorials up to date as much as I can.
