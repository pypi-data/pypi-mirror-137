# Notebooks Tutorials

These are machine learning projects / snippets transformed in tutorials and posted online.

So far I only have clean posted tutorials under **/pytorch**.

Under **/old_notebooks** I keep all old notebooks that I plan to clean and move to tutorials.

I also keep some random files that are part of the future integration of this package.
