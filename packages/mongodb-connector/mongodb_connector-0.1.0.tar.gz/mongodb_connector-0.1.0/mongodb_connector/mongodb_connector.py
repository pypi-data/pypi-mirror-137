"""
Connection methods
.close()
Close the connection now (rather than whenever .__del__() is called).

The connection will be unusable from this point forward; an Error (or subclass) exception will be raised if any operation is attempted with the connection. The same applies to all cursor objects trying to use the connection. Note that closing a connection without committing the changes first will cause an implicit rollback to be performed.

.commit()
Commit any pending transaction to the database.

Note that if the database supports an auto-commit feature, this must be initially off. An interface method may be provided to turn it back on.

Database modules that do not support transactions should implement this method with void functionality.

.rollback()
This method is optional since not all databases provide transaction support. [3]

In case a database does provide transactions this method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction. Closing a connection without committing the changes first will cause an implicit rollback to be performed.

.cursor()
Return a new Cursor Object using the connection.

If the database does not provide a direct cursor concept, the module will have to emulate cursors using other means to the extent needed by this specification. [4]

"""

"""
Constructors
Access to the database is made available through connection objects. The module must provide the following constructor for these:

connect( parameters... )
Constructor for creating a connection to the database.

Returns a Connection Object. It takes a number of parameters which are database dependent. [1]

Globals
These module globals must be defined:

apilevel
String constant stating the supported DB API level.

Currently only the strings "1.0" and "2.0" are allowed. If not given, a DB-API 1.0 level interface should be assumed.

threadsafety
Integer constant stating the level of thread safety the interface supports. Possible values are:

threadsafety	Meaning
0	Threads may not share the module.
1	Threads may share the module, but not connections.
2	Threads may share the module and connections.
3	Threads may share the module, connections and cursors.
Sharing in the above context means that two threads may use a resource without wrapping it using a mutex semaphore to implement resource locking. Note that you cannot always make external resources thread safe by managing access using a mutex: the resource may rely on global variables or other external sources that are beyond your control.

paramstyle
String constant stating the type of parameter marker formatting expected by the interface. Possible values are [2]:

paramstyle	Meaning
qmark	Question mark style, e.g. ...WHERE name=?
numeric	Numeric, positional style, e.g. ...WHERE name=:1
named	Named style, e.g. ...WHERE name=:name
format	ANSI C printf format codes, e.g. ...WHERE name=%s
pyformat	Python extended format codes, e.g. ...WHERE name=%(name)s
