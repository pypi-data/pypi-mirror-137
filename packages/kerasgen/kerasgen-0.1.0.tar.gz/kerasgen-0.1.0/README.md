[![Latest PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kerasgen.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kerasgen)
[![Latest Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/ma7555/kerasgen.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ma7555/kerasgen)

A Keras/Tensorflow compatible image data generator for creating balanced batches.
This datagenerator is compatible with TripletLoss as it guarantees the existence of postive pairs in every batch.

Installation
------------
```bash
pip install kerasgen
```

Usage
-----
```python
from kerasgen.balanced_image_dataset import balanced_image_dataset_from_directory

train_ds = balanced_image_dataset_from_directory(
    directory, num_classes_per_batch=2,
    num_images_per_class=5, image_size=(256, 256),
    validation_split=0.2, subset='training', seed=555,
    safe_triplet=True)

val_ds = balanced_image_dataset_from_directory(
    directory, num_classes_per_batch=2,
    num_images_per_class=5, image_size=(256, 256),
    validation_split=0.2, subset='validation', seed=555,
    safe_triplet=True)
```

Generates a balanced per batch `tf.data.Dataset` from image files in a directory.

  Your directory structure should be:

  ```
  main_directory/
  ...class_a/
  ......a_image_1.jpg
  ......a_image_2.jpg
  ...class_b/
  ......b_image_1.jpg
  ......b_image_2.jpg
  ```

  Setting `safe_triplet` to `True` does not guarantee that every epoch will include all
  different samples from the dataset. But as sampling is weighted per class, 
  every epoch will include a very high percentage of the dataset and should
  approach 100% as dataset size increases. This however guarantee that both
  num_classes_per_batch and num_images_per_class are fixed for all batches 
  including later ones.

  Batch size is calculated by multiplying num_classes_per_batch and num_images_per_class.
