## About

This repository holds those infrastructure-level modules,
that every application requires that follows the core 12-factor principles.

## Install

### Prerequisites
- Python3
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/)

### Install Python and module dependencies

Install Python 3, using some virtual environment.

Create and switch to a virtual environment dedicated to this project.

For development, install the package and its dependencies in editable mode, using task:

```bash
    task install-dev-editable
```

or directly with the pip command:

```bash

```

NOTE:
The `task install-...` tasks also installs git hooks (e.g. pre-commit).
The git hooks are simple bash scripts, that call tasks, for example the `pre-commit` hook will call the `task pre-commit` command.
