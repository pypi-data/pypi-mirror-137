    This function generates several scatter plots in polar coordinates. There are several 
    scatter plots, one for each algorithm being compared. 

    Each scatter plot in polar coordinates is associated to a given algorithm represented in the
    origin of the coordinate system.

    The plot is divided in several sectors, one sector for each of the other algorithms.
    For example, if we are comparing A1 with A2, A3, A4 and A5 then, the polar coordinate
    system is divided in four sectors, in which, from [0, 90] degrees we represent the
    probability that A1 is better than A2 and so on.

    The probability that an algorithm is better than another is represented by drawing
    one point per posterior sample in the corresponding sector of the scatter plot.
    For example, if algorithm A1 is better than algorithm A2 with probability p
    then, we generate a point in polar coordinates (r, p) with r âˆ¼ unif(0, 90).
