Problem Statement:
    Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.

The nearest neighbors of an instance are defined in terms of the standard Euclidean distance. In nearest-neighbor learning the target function may be either discrete-valued or real-valued.Let us first consider learning discrete-valued target functions of the form f: Rnâ†’V, where V is the finite set {vl, . . . vs}.')
