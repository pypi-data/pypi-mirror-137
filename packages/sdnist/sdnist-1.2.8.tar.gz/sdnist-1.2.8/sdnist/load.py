    Regarding the public/private/test datasets:
    - during the challenge, the participants were given access to the "public"
    dataset (`public=True`, `test=False) to make experiments and inspect data.
    - their synthesizers were evaluated against two new datasets which they
    were not allowed to see before:
        1) The (`public=False`, `test=False`) corresponds to a dataset to privatize.
        The results were published on the public leaderboard. The participants
        were allowed to make several submission. In traditional machine learning scenarios,
        this would somewhat correspond to a 'validation' dataset.
        2) The (`public=False`, `test=True`) corresponds to another dataset to privatize.
        This time, the results were kepts secret until the end of the challenge.
        In traditional machine learning scenarios, this would correspond to a 'test' dataset.
        Your synthesizer should not be finetuned for the best score on this dataset.
    - using any information available in the 'public' dataset is allowed.
    - manually inspecting any of the two 'private' dataset is not allowed within the challenge,
    even though there is nothing preventing you from doing so.
