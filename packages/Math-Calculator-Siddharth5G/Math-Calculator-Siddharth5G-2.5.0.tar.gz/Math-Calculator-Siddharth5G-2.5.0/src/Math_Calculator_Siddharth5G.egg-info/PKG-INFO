THIS SOFTAWRE CAN CALCULATE MULTIPLICATION, DIVISION, ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MODULUS, EXPONENT, PERCENTAGE, SQUARE ROOT AND FLOOR DIVISION.
HOW TO USE:
ENTER GUI TO USE GRAPHICAL CALCULATOR
ENTER TUI TO USE THE TERMINAL CALCULATOR
YOU MUST ENTER p BETWEEN 1 AND SECOND NUMBER WITH YOUR KEYBOARD IF YOU WANT TO USE PERCENTAGE, IT GIVES WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SECOND NUMBER THE FIRST NUMBER IS.
IF YOU ENTER ANYTHING ELSE, THE PROGRAM WILL DEFAULT TO THE GRAPHICAL INTERFACE
YOU MUST ENTER YOUR VALUES ACCORDDING TO THE PROMPT GIVEN.
EXCEPT IN SQUARE ROOT ONLY A VALUE IS USED SO TYPE 0 WHEN ASKED TO ENTER SECOND VALUE EVEN IF YOU HAVE TYPED NO IN RESET PROMPT
INCASE OF AN OPERATOR PROMPT:
  ADDITION = +
  SUBTRACTION = -
  MULTIPLICATION = X OR x
  DIVISION = /
  MODULUS = %
  FLOOR DIVISION = //
  EXPONENT = *
  SQUARE ROOT = sqr
  PERCENTAGE = p
WHEN ASKED TO QUIT YOU CAN EITHER PUT 'YES' WHICH WILL QUIT OR 'NO'.YOU WILL THEN BE PRESENTED WITH A CHOICE TO REST THE CALCULATOR OR NOT, IF YOU ENTER 'YES' YOU CAN START FROM THE BEGINNING ENTERING YOUR NUMBERS AND OPERATORS. IF YOU ENTER 'NO' YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THE SECOND NUMBER AND OPERATOR, DEPENDING ON THE OPERATOR, THE FIRST NUMBER WILL BE REPLACED WITH THE ANSWER OF THE PREVIOUS CALCULATION.
UNLESS YOU QUIT, THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK FOR AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT.

NEW FEATURES:

PROGRAM WILL DEFAULT TO TEXT BASED MATH CALCULATOR IN THE CASE OF ANY ERROR
ADDED SQUARE ROOT AS WELL AS PERCENT
OVERHAULED GRAPHICAL CALCULATOR
INPUT AND OUT WILL BE SHOWN IN DIFFERENT AREAS SO YOU CAN COPY YOUR INPUT EVEN AFTER GETTING THE OUTPUT, YOU CAN EDIT THE INPUT WITH YOU KEYBOARD BY CLICKING ON IT
DARKMODE INTRODUCED TO GRAPHICAL CALULATOR
TUTORIAL PAGE INTRODUCED
YOU CAN CHOOSE IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESIZE THE WINDOW(BUTTONS DO NOT GET RESIZED SO RESIZING IS BUGGY, WILL GET FIXED IN A LATER VERSION)
MENUBAR INTRODUCED CONTAINING ABOVE SETTINGS
