Introduction
============

The Robust design optimization of renewable Hydrogen and dErIved energy cArrier systems (RHEIA) framework provides 
multi-objective optimization (deterministic and stochastic) and uncertainty quantification algorithms. 
These algorithms can be applied on hydrogen-based energy systems, which are included in RHEIA.
In addition, RHEIA allows to connect your own models to the algorithms as well.

A brief overview on the features of RHEIA is provided in :ref:`lab:functionalities`,
followed by a detailed illustration on how to connect your own model (Python based, open source or closed source) in :ref:`lab:connectingyourownmodel`.
If these features comply with your need, the installation procedure and package dependencies are illustrated in :ref:`installationlabel`. 
As a first step, the :ref:`lab:tutorial` provides an initiation of using the framework on a hydrogen-based energy system. 
Additional examples are illustrated in :ref:`lab:examples`. 
The models are characterized by a design space, which defines the design variables, and a stochastic space when parameter uncertainty is considered.
Those spaces are defined in two files, which are elaborated in :ref:`lab:stochasticdesignspace`.
The guides to perform the deterministic design optimization, robust design optimization and uncertainty quantification are present in :ref:`lab:optimization` and 
:ref:`lab:uncertaintyquantification`, respectively.
The hydrogen-based energy system models are described in :ref:`lab:energysystemmodels`, including the uncertainty characterization of the techno-economic and environmental parameters, a script to evaluate the performance of specific designs and a method to get the climate data and demand data for your location of interest. The documentation concludes with brief details on the optimization and uncertainty quantification algorithms (:ref:`lab:methods`), the :ref:`lab:APIref` and the details on how to contribute to the framework (:ref:`lab:contribution`).
