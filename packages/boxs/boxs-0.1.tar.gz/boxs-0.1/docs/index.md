# Boxs

Boxs is a python library that manages data automatically and keeps track of different
versions of the same data created in different runs of the same script. No more need to manually
think about file paths and S3 keys, just store the data and let boxs manage the rest.
Besides managing the version history of the data, boxs allows to track the dependencies between
different artifacts. It is meant as a tool for making it easy to manage artifacts in workflows
for data science and machine learning. It is currently under development
by [Kantai GmbH](https://kant.ai) and licensed under
[MIT License](https://gitlab.com/kantai/boxs/-/blob/mainline/LICENSE).
