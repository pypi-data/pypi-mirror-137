# ADQ Persistence Framework for Dynamo DB

This project was made to optimize the Dynamo DB Persistence implementation code to a basic Entity CRUD operations for Python ADQ projects

[The source for this project is available here][src].

Most of the configuration for a Python project is done in the `setup.py` file,
an example of which is included in this project. You should edit this file
accordingly to adapt this sample project to your needs.

----

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and can be written using
[reStructuredText][rst] or [markdown][md use] with the appropriate [key set][md
use]. It will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be
displayed as the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be
written for that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a
good idea, although a simple “What's New” section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
