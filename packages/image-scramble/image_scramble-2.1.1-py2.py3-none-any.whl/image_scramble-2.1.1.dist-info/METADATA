Split image into tiles and scramble/unscramble them based on a seed. The demo application can be found at [https://image-scramble.herokuapp.com](https://image-scramble.herokuapp.com).

---

### Scramble

Using scramble mode on [this sample image](./examples/en_Pepper-and-Carrot_by-David-Revoy_E05P01_p2.png) will produce the following output:

![example_scramble](./examples/v1.0.0/en_Pepper-and-Carrot_by-David-Revoy_E05P01_p2_v1.0.0-prng.png)

### Unscramble

To revert the image to its original state, use the same `seed` and `slice_size` on unscramble mode.

## Credits

* Pycasso is a Python version of [webcaetano/image-scramble](https://github.com/webcaetano/image-scramble) and [webcaetano/shuffle-seed](https://github.com/webcaetano/shuffle-seed). This also uses a stripped-down port of [davidbau/seedrandom](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom) to initialize the PRNG.

* Sample image is taken from [Pepper&Carrot](https://peppercarrot.com/) by David Revoy licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/license/index.html).

## Setup

### Install from PyPI

```bash
$ pip install image-scramble
```

### Install from source

* `cd` into `pycasso` directory.
* Run `python setup.py install` to install package.

## Usage

### Web application

* Run `python app/app.py`

### Docker

* Build from local using:

```
docker build -t "image-scramble" .
docker --name pycasso -p 5000:5000 -d image-scramble
```

* Get image from hub:

```
docker pull image-scramble
```

### Command-line utility

You can get started by using the command-line utility to scramble or unscramble an image by:

```bash
$ pycasso image_input.png image_output scramble
```

Use `--help` for more options.

### Script

Initialize a `Canvas` and use scramble on `export` by:

```python
from pycasso import Canvas
Canvas('image_input.png', (30, 30), 'seed').export('scramble', 'image_output', 'jpeg')
```
