Description: NoelOCR is a Python Library for extracting text from scanned PDF and full text PDF
        developed by Noel Moses Mwadende. 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        How it works ?
        
        
        
        processPDF module from NoelOCR takes scanned PDF process it and
        output searchabel/plain text.
        
        
        
        
        
        For whom it was developed ?
        
        
        
        It was developed for Machine Learning engineer who deals with PDF.
        It might be classification of scanned PDF, text extraction from
        scanned PDF or any task which requires feature extraction from
        scanned PDF. Not only that, NoelOCR is very flexible as it can
        also extract text from full text PDF. That means it works for both,
        full text PDF and scanned PDF though it was purposefuly created
        for scanned PDF.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        How to use it ? 
        
        
        
        import NoelOCR as nm
        
        text = nm.processPDF('moses.pdf')
        
        print(text)
        
        
        
        
        
        It works for Linux operating system. The module for Windows
        will be added in Beta version.
