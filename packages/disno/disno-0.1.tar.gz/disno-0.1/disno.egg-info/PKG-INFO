# disno
A modular API wrapper designed to handle the many aspects of the [Discord API](https://discord.dev).

What is meant by modular is that you can resuse components for other parts of the library or your custom implementations.

> The library is currently in early development.

## Is this a fork of discord.py?
This library does inspire greatly from [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
but is essentially different and aims to implement features that discord.py didn't as well
as features it hasn't.
