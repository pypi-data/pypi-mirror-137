    Apply patches to the pathlib module

    We abuse the patch manager here to actually repatch a _class_.  This is necessary
    because pathlib stores references to a bunch of os module functions within an
    accessor class. Since pathlib is part of the standard library, this happens
    before our patching machinery is applied, which means the accessor retains
    references to the _original_ functions, and not our patched versions. We can't
    simply run repatch_module on pathlib itself because the references are in the
    class definition and not at module level. But if we explicitly repatch the
    _class_, everything works out just fine.

    Currently we would potentially miss cases where a custom accessor class was used
    (assuming the custom accessor was also defined before our patches applied). In
    theory, we could handle this by repatching the given accessor at the time each
    pathlib.Path is instantiated. However, given the fact that this functionality isn't
    even documented, I don't think it's worth pursuing right now.
