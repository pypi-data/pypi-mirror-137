    Do not instantiate this class; call `instrument_adapter` or subclass it.

    This class provides machinery to instrument a totally generic, PEP-249 compliant
    adapter. We only have a reference to the adapter module, and we can't make any
    assumptions about the existence of `adapter.Cursor`, since this is not guaranteed
    by the spec.

    We are only guaranteed the following:
    - the adapter has a `connection()` method, which returns an instance of Connection
    - the Connection object has a `cursor()` method, which returns an instance of Cursor
    - the Cursor has `execute()` and `executemany()` methods

    This requires a somewhat roundabout instrumentation strategy:
    - on the first call to adapter.connect(), we can instrument the Connection class
    - on the first call to Connection.cursor(), we can instrument the Cursor class
    - this lets us instrument Cursor.execute() and Cursor.executemany()

        Takes the arguments from a call to connect() and extracts information for
        database inventory reporting. By default only works with kwargs - we expect this
        to be by far the most common case.

        different adapters are used. Most, if not all, use kwargs. Some adapters support
        a DSN connection string, but that should be handled by subclasses (if at all).
