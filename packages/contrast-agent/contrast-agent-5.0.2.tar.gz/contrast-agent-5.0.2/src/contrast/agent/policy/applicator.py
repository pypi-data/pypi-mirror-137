    Static methods and class methods are implemented as descriptors. When one of these
    methods is called on the parent object, it uses the descriptor protocol, which
    means that the underlying function objects are not seen directly by the caller.

    In order to access the staticmethod/classmethod objects directly, they must be
    accessed via the parent object's __dict__ attribute.

    For example,

    class D:
        @staticmethod
        def sm():
            pass

    If I do this:
    D.sm will call __get__ under the hood to get the function definition (this is
    what's wrapped inside the staticmethod or classmethod obj in this case)

    If we do this:
    D.__dict__['sm'] we get the underlying staticmethod/classmethod object. This is
    required because we need to do a type check in order to replace the original obj
    with our own function of the correct type.

    This shows examples of C code re-written in python for the __get__ desc
    implementation for classmethod, staticmethod and function
