Description: # Hilldust
        (UNOFFICIAL) Yet another implementation of *Hillstoneâ„¢ Secure Connect VPN Client* for Linux
        
        and for macOS later.
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        ./hilldust.py vpn.yourdomain.com:12345 username password
        ```
        As `vpn.yourdomain.com:12345` is your VPN provider's address.
        
        ## Notes
        For now, it is only a proof-of-concept and may be not available for all the users,
        because it only supports auth: `HMAC-SHA1-96`, crypto: `3DES-CBC`.
        
        ## Dependencies
        - Python 3
        - scapy (Python module)
        - cryptography (Python module)
        - iproute2
        
        Please note different systems may have different names for Python 3.
        It can be: `python3` with `pip3`, or `python` with `pip`,
        
        You may use the shortcut: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all
        Python modules the program needs.
        
        You may use `ip -Version` to check if your system is missing iproute2 utility.
