PySimPlot
=========

PySimPlot takes an alignment of two or more sequences (nucleotide or amino acid) in fasta format and then calculates the identity between them within a rolling window. The resulting data are returned plotted and optionally saved as a csv file for you to format with Excel etc.

This software is based on the original [SimPlot](https://sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/SimPlot/) by Stuart Ray.

Example Usage:

    clustalo -i sequences.fasta -o aligned.fasta
    pysimplot -i aligned.fasta -o data.csv
