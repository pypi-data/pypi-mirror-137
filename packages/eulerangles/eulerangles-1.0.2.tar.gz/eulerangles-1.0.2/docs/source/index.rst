The eulerangles documentation
=======================================

`Euler angles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles>`_ are often used to represent rigid body rotations in 3D.

These transformations can be defined in many different ways.
The world of transformations is filled with
`ambiguities <https://rock-learning.github.io/pytransform3d/transformation_ambiguities.html>`_ which can make it harder
than necessary to interface softwares which define their transformations differently.

This package is designed to simplify the handling of large sets of
Euler angles in Python.
