# # ðŸ¥­ TradeExecutor
#
# This file deals with executing trades. We want the interface to be as simple as:
# ```
# trade_executor.buy("ETH", 2.5)
# ```
# but this (necessarily) masks a great deal of complexity. The aim is to keep the complexity
# around trades within these `TradeExecutor` classes.
#

# # ðŸ¥­ TradeExecutor class
#
# This abstracts the process of placing trades, based on our typed objects.
#
# It's abstracted because we may want to have different approaches to executing these
# trades - do we want to run them against the Serum orderbook? Would it be faster if we
# ran them against Raydium?
#
# Whichever choice is made, the calling code shouldn't have to care. It should be able to
# use its `TradeExecutor` class as simply as:
# ```
# trade_executor.buy("ETH", 2.5)
# ```

# # ðŸ¥­ ImmediateTradeExecutor class
#
# This class puts an IOC trade on the orderbook with the expectation it will be filled
# immediately. It follows the pattern described here:
#   https://solanadev.blogspot.com/2021/05/order-techniques-with-project-serum.html
#
# Basically, it tries to send a 'market buy/sell' and settle all in one transaction.
#
# The ImmediateTradeExecutor constructor takes a `price_adjustment_factor` to allow
# moving the price it is willing to pay away from the mid-price. Testing shows the price is
# filled at the orderbook price if the price we specify is worse, so it looks like it's
# possible to be quite liberal with this adjustment. In a live test:
# * Original wallet USDT value was 342.8606.
# * `price_adjustment_factor` was 0.05.
# * ETH price was 2935.14 USDT (on 2021-05-02).
# * Adjusted price was 3081.897 USDT, adjusted by 1.05 from 2935.14
# * Buying 0.1 ETH specifying 3081.897 as the price resulted in:
#   * Buying 0.1 ETH
#   * Spending 294.1597 USDT
# * After settling, the wallet should hold 342.8606 USDT - 294.1597 USDT = 48.7009 USDT
# * The wallet did indeed hold 48.7009 USDT
#
# So: the specified BUY price of 3081.897 USDT was taken as a maximum, and orders were taken
# from the orderbook starting at the current cheapest, until the order was filled or (I'm
# assuming) the price exceeded the price specified.
