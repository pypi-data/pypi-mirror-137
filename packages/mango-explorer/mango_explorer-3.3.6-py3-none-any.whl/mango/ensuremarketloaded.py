# # ðŸ¥­ ensure_market_loaded function
#
# This function ensures that a `Market` is 'loaded' and not a 'stub'. Stubs are handy for laoding in
# bulk, for instance in a market lookup, but real processing usually requires a fully loaded `Market`.
#
# This function simplifies turning a stub into a fully-loaded, usable market.

# # ðŸ¥­ load_market_by_symbol
#
# This function takes a `Context` and a market symbol string (like "ETH/USDC") and returns a loaded market. It
# throws if anything goes wrong rather than return None.
