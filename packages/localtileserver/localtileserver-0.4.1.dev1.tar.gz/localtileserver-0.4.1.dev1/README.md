*Need to visualize a rather large (gigabytes) raster you have locally?* **This is for you.**

A Flask application for serving tiles from large raster files in
the [Slippy Maps standard](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames)
(i.e., `/zoom/x/y.png`)

## üåü Highlights

- Create a tile server for large geospatial images
- View local or remote* raster files with `ipyleaflet`, `folium`, CesiumJS, and more!
- Extract regions of interest (ROIs) interactively
- Use the example datasets to generate Digital Elevation Models

**remote raster files should be pre-tiled Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs*

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

This is a Flask application (blueprint) for serving tiles of large images.
The `TileClient` class can be used to to launch a tile server in a background
thread which will serve raster imagery to a viewer (see `ipyleaflet` and
`folium` Jupyter notebook examples below).

This tile server can efficiently deliver varying levels of detail of your
raster imagery to your viewer; it helps to have pre-tiled, Cloud Optimized
GeoTIFFs (COG), but no wories if not as the backing libraries,
[`large_image`](https://github.com/girder/large_image),
will tile and cache for you when opening the raster.

There is an included, standalone web viewer leveraging
[CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/) and [GeoJS](https://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/).
You can use the web viewer to select and extract regions of interest from rasters.

**Disclaimer**: This is a hobby project and I am doing my best to make it
more stable/robust. Things might break between minor releases (I use the
`major.minor.patch` versioning scheme).


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Get started with `localtileserver` to view rasters locally in Jupyter or
deploy in your own Flask application.

### üêç Installing with `conda`

Conda makes managing `localtileserver`'s dependencies across platforms quite
easy and this is the recommended method to install:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge localtileserver
```

### üé° Installing with `pip`

If you prefer pip, and know how to install GDAL on your system, then you can
install from PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/localtileserver/

```
pip install localtileserver
```

#### üìù A Brief Note on Installing GDAL

GDAL can be a pain in the üçë to install, so you may want to handle GDAL
before installing `localtileserver` when using `pip`.

If on linux, I highly recommend using the [large_image_wheels](https://github.com/girder/large_image_wheels) from Kitware.

```
pip install --find-links=https://girder.github.io/large_image_wheels --no-cache GDAL
```

### üß¨ Flask Blueprint

Under the hood, `localtileserver` is a basic Flask Blueprint that can be easily
incorporated into any Flask application. To utilize in your own application:

```py
from flask import Flask
from localtileserver.tileserver.blueprint import cache, tileserver

app = Flask(__name__)
cache.init_app(app)
app.register_blueprint(tileserver, url_prefix='/')
```

There is an example Flask application and deployment in
[`banesullivan/remotetileserver`](https://github.com/banesullivan/remotetileserver)

### ‚öõÔ∏è Standalone Electron App

If you're interested in using `localtileserver` as a standalone application,
check out this experimental Electron app:
[`banesullivan/localtileserver-electron`](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver-electron)

### üê≥ Docker

Included in this repository's packages is a pre-built Docker image that can be
used as a local tile serving service. To use, pull the image and run it by
mounting your local volume where the imagery is stored and forward port 8000.

This is particularly useful if you do not want to install GDAL on your system
or want a dedicated and isolated service for tile serving.

To use the docker image:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/banesullivan/localtileserver:latest
docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/banesullivan/localtileserver:latest
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. You can pass the `?filename=`
argument in the URL parameters to access any URL/S3 raster image file.

You can mount your local file system to access files on your filesystem. For
example, mount your Desktop by:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /Users/bane/Desktop/:/data/ ghcr.io/banesullivan/localtileserver:latest
```

Then add the `?filename=` parameter to the URL in your browser to access the
local files. Since this is mounted under `/data/` in the container, you must
build the path as `/data/<filename on Desktop>`, such that the URL would be:
http://localhost:8000/?filename=/data/TC_NG_SFBay_US_Geo.tif

#### üìì Jupyter in Docker

There is also a pre-built image with localtileserver configured to be used in
Jupyer from a Docker container.

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/banesullivan/localtileserver-jupyter:latest
```

## üöÄ Usage

`localtileserver` can be used in a few different ways:

- In a Jupyter notebook with [`ipyleaflet`](#-ipyleaflet-tile-layers) or [`folium`](#-folium-tile-layers)
- From the [commandline in a web browser](#%EF%B8%8F-local-web-application)
- With remote [Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs](#%EF%B8%8F-remote-cloud-optimized-geotiffs-cogs)


### üçÉ `ipyleaflet` Tile Layers

The `TileClient` class is a nifty tool to launch a tile server as a background
thread to serve image tiles from any raster file on your local file system.
Additionally, it can be used in conjunction with the `get_leaflet_tile_layer`
utility to create an `ipyleaflet.TileLayer` for interactive visualization in
a Jupyter notebook. Here is an example:


```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, TileClient
from ipyleaflet import Map

# First, create a tile server from local raster file
tile_client = TileClient('~/Desktop/TC_NG_SFBay_US_Geo.tif')

# Create ipyleaflet tile layer from that server
t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(tile_client)

# Create ipyleaflet map, add tile layer, and display
m = Map(center=tile_client.center())
m.add_layer(t)
m
```

#### ü•ì Two Rasters at Once

```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer
from ipyleaflet import Map, ScaleControl, FullScreenControl, SplitMapControl

# Create 2 tile layers from 2 separate raster files
l = get_leaflet_tile_layer('~/Desktop/TC_NG_SFBay_US_Geo.tif',
                           band=1, palette='viridis', vmin=50, vmax=200)
r = get_leaflet_tile_layer('~/Desktop/small.tif',
                           band=2, palette='plasma', vmin=0, vmax=150)

# Make the ipyleaflet map
m = Map(center=(37.7249511580583, -122.27230466902257), zoom=9)
control = SplitMapControl(left_layer=l, right_layer=r)
m.add_control(control)
m.add_control(ScaleControl(position='bottomleft'))
m.add_control(FullScreenControl())
m
```

#### üßÆ Controlling the RGB Bands

The `ipyleaflet` and `folium` tile layer utilities support setting which bands
to view as the RGB channels. To set the RGB bands, pass a length three list
of the band indices to the `band` argument.

Here is an example where I create two tile layers from the same raster but
viewing a different set of bands:

```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, TileClient
from ipyleaflet import Map, ScaleControl, FullScreenControl, SplitMapControl

# First, create a tile server from local raster file
tile_client = TileClient('landsat.tif')

# Create 2 tile layers from same raster viewing different bands
l = get_leaflet_tile_layer(tile_client, band=[7, 5, 4])
r = get_leaflet_tile_layer(tile_client, band=[5, 3, 2])

# Make the ipyleaflet map
m = Map(center=tile_client.center(), zoom=12)
control = SplitMapControl(left_layer=l, right_layer=r)
m.add_control(control)
m.add_control(ScaleControl(position='bottomleft'))
m.add_control(FullScreenControl())
m
```

#### üéØ Using `ipyleaflet` for ROI Extraction

I have included the `get_leaflet_roi_controls` utility to create some leaflet
UI controls for extracting regions of interest from a tile client. You can
use it as follows and then draw a polygon and click the "Extract ROI" button.

The outputs are save in your working directory by default (next to the Jupyter notebook).

```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, get_leaflet_roi_controls
from localtileserver import TileClient
from ipyleaflet import Map

# First, create a tile server from local raster file
tile_client = TileClient('~/Desktop/TC_NG_SFBay_US_Geo.tif')

# Create ipyleaflet tile layer from that server
t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(tile_client)

# Create ipyleaflet controls to extract an ROI
draw_control, roi_control = get_leaflet_roi_controls(tile_client)

# Create ipyleaflet map, add layers, add controls, and display
m = Map(center=(37.7249511580583, -122.27230466902257), zoom=9)
m.add_layer(t)
m.add_control(draw_control)
m.add_control(roi_control)
m
```

![ipyleaflet-draw-roi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/ipyleaflet-draw-roi.png)


### üå≥ `folium` Tile Layers

Similarly to the support provided for `ipyleaflet`, I have included a utility
to generate a [`folium.TileLayer`](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/modules.html#folium.raster_layers.TileLayer)
with `get_folium_tile_layer`. Here is an example with almost the exact same
code as the `ipyleaflet` example, just note that `Map` is imported from
`folium` and we use `add_child` instead of `add_layer`:


```py
from localtileserver import get_folium_tile_layer
from localtileserver import TileClient
from folium import Map

# First, create a tile server from local raster file
tile_client = TileClient('~/Desktop/TC_NG_SFBay_US_Geo.tif')

# Create folium tile layer from that server
t = get_folium_tile_layer(tile_client)

m = Map(location=tile_client.center())
m.add_child(t)
m
```

![folium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/folium.png)


### ‚òÅÔ∏è Remote Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs (COGs)

While `localtileserver` is intended to be used only with raster files existing
on your local filesystem, there is support for URL files through GDAL's
[Virtual Storage Interface](https://gdal.org/user/virtual_file_systems.html).
Simply pass your `http<s>://` or `s3://` URL to the `TileClient`. This will
work quite well for pre-tiled Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs, but I do not recommend
doing this with non-tiled raster formats.

For example, the raster at the url below is ~3GiB but because it is pre-tiled,
we can view tiles of the remote file very efficiently in a Jupyter notebook.

```py
from localtileserver import get_folium_tile_layer
from localtileserver import TileClient
from folium import Map

url = 'https://opendata.digitalglobe.com/events/california-fire-2020/pre-event/2018-02-16/pine-gulch-fire20/1030010076004E00.tif'

# First, create a tile server from local raster file
tile_client = TileClient(url)

# Create folium tile layer from that server
t = get_folium_tile_layer(tile_client)

m = Map(location=tile_client.center())
m.add_child(t)
m
```

![vsi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/vsi-raster.png)

Note that the Virtual Storage Interface is a complex API, and `TileClient`
currently only handles `vsis3` and `vsicurl`. If you need a different VFS
mechanism, simply create your `/vsi` path and pass that to `TileClient`.

### üó∫Ô∏è Example Datasets

A few example datasets are included with `localtileserver`. A particularly
useful one has global elevation data which you can use to create high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of a local region.

```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, get_leaflet_roi_controls, examples
from ipyleaflet import Map

# Load example tile layer from publicly available DEM source
tile_client = examples.get_elevation()

# Create ipyleaflet tile layer from that server
t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(tile_client,
                           band=1, vmin=-500, vmax=5000,
                           palette='plasma',
                           opacity=0.75)

# Create ipyleaflet controls to extract an ROI
draw_control, roi_control = get_leaflet_roi_controls(tile_client)

m = Map(zoom=2)
m.add_layer(t)
m.add_control(draw_control)
m.add_control(roi_control)
m
```

![elevation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/elevation.png)


Then you can follow the same routine as described above to extract an ROI.

I zoomed in over Golden, Colorado and drew a polygon of the extent of the DEM I would like to create:

![golden](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/golden-roi.png)

And perform the extraction:

```py

roi_path = '...'  # Look in your working directory

r = get_leaflet_tile_layer(roi_path, band=1,
                           palette='plasma', opacity=0.75)

m2 = Map(
        center=(39.763427033262175, -105.20614908076823),
        zoom=12,
       )
m2.add_layer(r)
m2
```

![golden-dem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/golden-dem.png)

Here is another example with the Virtual Earth satellite imagery

```py
from localtileserver import get_leaflet_tile_layer, examples
from ipyleaflet import Map

# Load example tile layer from publicly available imagery
tile_client = examples.get_virtual_earth()

# Create ipyleaflet tile layer from that server
t = get_leaflet_tile_layer(tile_client, opacity=1)

m = Map(center=(39.751343612695145, -105.22181306125279), zoom=18)
m.add_layer(t)
m
```

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Web Application

Launch the tileserver from the commandline to use the included web application where you can view the raster and extract regions of interest.

```bash
python -m localtileserver path/to/raster.tif
```

![cesium-viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/cesium-viewer.png)

You can use the web viewer to extract regions of interest:

![webviewer-roi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/banesullivan/localtileserver/main/imgs/webviewer-roi.gif)


You can also launch the web viewer with any of the available example datasets:

```py
python -m localtileserver dem
```

Available choices are:

- `dem` or `elevation`: global elevation dataset
- `blue_marble`: Blue Marble satellite imagery
- `virtual_earth`: Microsoft's satellite/aerial imagery
- `arcgis`: ArcGIS World Street Map
- `bahamas`: Sample raster over the Bahamas


### üóíÔ∏è Usage Notes

- `get_leaflet_tile_layer` accepts either an existing `TileClient` or a
path from which to create a `TileClient` under the hood.
- The color palette choices come from [`palettable`](https://jiffyclub.github.io/palettable/).
- If matplotlib is installed, any matplotlib colormap name cane be used a palette choice
