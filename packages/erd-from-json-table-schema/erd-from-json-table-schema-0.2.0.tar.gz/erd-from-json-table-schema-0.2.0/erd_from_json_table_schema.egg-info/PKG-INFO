erd-from-json-table-schema
==========================

Does what it says on the tin; creates an entity-relationship diagram from a [JSON Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)

Massive thanks to [iburadempa](https://github.com/iburadempa/) for creating [jts_erd](https://github.com/iburadempa/jts_erd), from which this code is derived. jts_erd was designed with Postgres exports in mind; this code assumes a slightly different packaging structure and so probably won't work for that use case. 

Development has used Python 3.8.
