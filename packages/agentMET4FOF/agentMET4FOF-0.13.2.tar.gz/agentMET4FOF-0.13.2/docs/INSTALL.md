# Installation of agentMET4FOF

As already mentioned in the README, agentMET4FOF can either be [installed as a Python 
package](#install-agentmet4fof-as-a-python-package) or [launched in a Docker 
container](#use-agentmet4fof-from-inside-a-docker-container).

## Install agentMET4FOF as a Python package

The installation of agentMET4FOF is as straightforward as the Python ecosystem suggests.
In the [video tutorial series linked in the README
](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF#video-tutorial-series) we guide you 
through every step until you have agentMET4FOF running on your machine.

If you want to take the steps manually we guide you through in this document.

### Set up a virtual environment

For the motivation of creating a virtual environment for your installation of the
agents check [the official Python docs on that topic
](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#introduction). You have the option 
to do this with _Anaconda_, if you already have it installed, or use the Python 
built-in tool `venv`. The commands differ slightly between [Windows
](#create-a-venv-python-environment-on-windows) and [Mac/Linux
](#create-a-venv-python-environment-on-mac-linux) or if you use [Anaconda
](#create-an-anaconda-python-environment).

#### Create a `venv` Python environment on Windows

In your Windows PowerShell execute the following to set up a virtual environment in
a folder of your choice.

```shell
PS C:> cd C:\LOCAL\PATH\TO\ENVS
PS C:\LOCAL\PATH\TO\ENVS> py -3 -m venv agentMET4FOF_venv
PS C:\LOCAL\PATH\TO\ENVS> agentMET4FOF_venv\Scripts\activate
```
Proceed to [the next step](#install-agentmet4fof-via-pip).

#### Create a `venv` Python environment on Mac & Linux

In your terminal execute the following to set up a virtual environment in a folder
of your choice.

```shell
$ cd /LOCAL/PATH/TO/ENVS
$ python3 -m venv agentMET4FOF_venv
$ source agentMET4FOF_venv/bin/activate
```
Proceed to [the next step](#install-agentmet4fof-via-pip).

#### Create an Anaconda Python environment

To get started with your present *Anaconda* installation just go to *Anaconda
prompt* and execute

```shell
$ cd /LOCAL/PATH/TO/ENVS
$ conda env create --file /LOCAL/PATH/TO/agentMET4FOF/environment.yml 
```
That's it!

### Install agentMET4FOF via `pip`

Once you activated your virtual environment, you can install agentMET4FOF via:

```shell
pip install agentMET4FOF
```

```shell
Collecting agentMET4FOF
[...]
Successfully installed agentMET4FOF-[...] [...]
```
That's it!

## Use agentMET4FOF from inside a Docker container

Every version of agentMET4FOF since
[v0.9.1dev](https://github.com/Met4FoF/agentMET4FOF/releases/tag/v0.9.1dev) is
additionally accompanied by a so-called
[Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container-image). With 
its help, agentMET4FOF can be launched quickly on any computer with a
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) installation without 
installing Python. agentMET4FOF can then be used directly in the browser using the 
supplied or your own Jupyter notebooks and even the dashboard can be
visited in the browser after its launch. The following steps are required for this.

1. [Install Docker](#install-docker)
1. a) [Start a container from the image for local use](#start-a-container-from-the-image-for-local-use)
   
   b) [Deploy the containerized agents via a webserver](#deploy-the-containerized-agents-via-a-webserver)

### Install Docker

The [official Docker documentation
](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#download-and-install-docker) guides you through.
Please continue with [the next step](#download-and-import-the-agentMET4FO-docker-image),
once you completed the Docker installation.

### Start a container from the image for local use

You can download and launch the [Docker image
](https://hub.docker.com/p/met4fof/agentmet4fof) straight away with Docker's built-in 
[`run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) command

```bash
> docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8050:8050 --rm met4fof/agentMET4FOF
```

In this command's output you will find the usual Jupyter Notebook token 
URL, which you can open in your browser. After starting an agent network in one of 
the tutorials or your own notebooks, you will find the dashboard URL in the 
notebook's output resembling something like `http://0.0.0.0:8050`.

### Deploy the containerized agents via a webserver

To make the agents accessible via a TCP/IP network such as the internet using a web 
server like [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), all that is required is the correct 
webserver configuration. The example configuration presented here will spawn the 
container so that the Jupyter Notebook server is accessible via http://agent.domain.com,
and the dashboard is accessible after start-up under
http://agent.domain.com/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME_OF_CHOICE.

#### Start the container with the dashboard at a subfolder

Download and launch the container with

```bash
> docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 8050:8050 --rm  \ 
--env DASH_URL_BASE_PATHNAME=/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME_OF_CHOICE/ met4fof/agentMET4FOF
```

This ensures, that the dashboard will be reachable under whatever domain you are
using followed by `/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME_OF_CHOICE`.

#### Configure the Nginx

We assume you are confident in using Nginx in general. The corresponding
configuration should contain the following server blocks to ensure the Jupyter
Notebook server is working, as well as the dashboard

```text
server {
        server_name agent.domain.com;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

            # websocket headers
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;

            proxy_buffering off;
        }

        location /YOUR_FOLDER_NAME_OF_CHOICE/ {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8050/YOUR_FOLDER_NAME_OF_CHOICE/;
        }

    [...]

}
```
