def uniform_hypergraph_configuration_model(k, m):
    """
    A function to generate an m-uniform configuration model

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : dictionary
        This is a dictionary where the keys are node ids
        and the values are node degrees.
    m : int
        specifies the hyperedge size

    Returns
    -------
    Hypergraph object
        The generated hypergraph

    Warns
    -----
    warnings.warn
        If the sums of the degrees are not divisible by m, the
        algorithm still runs, but raises a warning and adds an
        additional connection to random nodes to satisfy this
        condition.

    Notes
    -----
    Creates multi-edges and self-loops.
