"""
View Classes provide node, edge, degree, and edge size "views" of a hypergraph.

A view means a read-only object that is quick to create, automatically
updated when the hypergraph changes, and provides basic access like `n in V`,
`for n in V`, `V[n]` and sometimes set operations.

The views are read-only iterable containers that are updated as the
hypergraph is updated. As with dicts, the hypergraph should not be updated
while iterating through the view. Views can be iterated multiple times.

Edge and Node views also allow data attribute lookup.
The resulting attribute dict is writable as `H.edges[3]['color']='red'`
Degree views allow lookup of degree values for single nodes.
Weighted degree is supported with the `weight` argument.

NodeView
========

    `V = H.nodes` (or `V = H.nodes()`) allows `len(V)`, `n in V`, set
    operations e.H. "H.nodes & H.nodes", and `dd = H.nodes[n]`, where
    `dd` is the node data dict. Iteration is over the nodes by default.

EdgeView
========

    `V = H.edges` or `V = H.edges()` allows iteration over edges as well as
    `e in V`, set operations and edge data lookup by edge ID `dd = H.edges[2]`.
    Iteration is over edge IDs for Hypergraph.

    Set operations are currently performed by id, not by set equivalence.
    This may be in future functionality. As it stands, however, the same edge
    can be added more than once using different IDs

DegreeView
==========

    `V = H.degree` allows iteration over (node, degree) pairs as well
    as lookup: `deg=V[n]`. Weighted degree using edge data attributes
    is provided via `V = H.degree(weight='attr_name')` where any string
    with the attribute name can be used. `weight=None` is the default.
    No set operations are implemented for degrees, use NodeView.

    The argument `nbunch` restricts iteration to nodes in nbunch.
    The DegreeView can still look up any node even if nbunch is specified.

EdgeSizeView
============

    `V = H.edge_size` allows iteration over (edge, size) pairs as well
    as lookup: `size=V[e]`. Weighted edge size using node data attributes
    is provided via `V = H.edge_size(weight='attr_name')` where any string
    with the attribute name can be used. `weight=None` is the default.
    No set operations are implemented for edge size, use EdgeView.

    The argument `nbunch` restricts iteration to nodes in nbunch.
    The EdgeSizeView can still look up any node even if nbunch is specified.
