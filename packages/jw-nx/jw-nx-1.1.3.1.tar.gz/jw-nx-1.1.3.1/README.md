### About package
This package provides an authentication mechanism for Django Rest Framework based on JSON Web Tokens in the browser-backed up Knox-powered tokens in the database.  
This package aims to take the better parts of both worlds, including 
- Expirable tokens: The tokens may be manually expired in the database, so a user can log out of all other logged-in places, or everywhere.   
 - Different tokens per login attempt (per user-agent): A user's session is tied to the specific machine and logging can be segregated per usage.  
  - JWT-base tokens: The token can have an embedded expiration time and further metadata for other applications.  
  - Only the tokens' hashes are stored in the database: So that even if the database gets dumped, an attacker cannot impersonate people through existing credentials.  
  - Access and refresh token: Like the rest-framework-simplejwt package, this package create refresh token and access token in login attempt and authentication is working with the access token.  
 - Other applications sharing the JWT private key can also decrypt the JWT.  
 - This package provides some endpoint for getting some data about the statuses of tokens.  
 
**Note**  : Token_key that provided by knox, is set in payload of access and refresh token.
