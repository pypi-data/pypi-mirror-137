# Trading Strategy QSTrader

This is patched and bug fixed version for [QSTrader library](https://github.com/mhallsmoore/qstrader). This package is a dependency for [tradingstrategy](https://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/client) package.

The QSTrader project was forked and the fork released on a different PyPi package name `trading-strategy-qstrader` because the original project by Michael Halls-Moore was unmaintained and unusable as a PyPi package dependency.

**Warning**: This package is currently under active development to become suitable for crypto trading. APIs are likely to break.
