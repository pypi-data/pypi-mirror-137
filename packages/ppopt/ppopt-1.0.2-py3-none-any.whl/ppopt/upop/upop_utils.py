    """
    Generates the list of indices of the fundamental hyperplanes of the solution, as well as the indices of the associated hyperplanes from the original solution and the parity of the constraint

    This is linear w.r.t. number of hyper planes and is quite quick ~25 ns per constraint in the solution

    It first creates approximate(near exact) integer representations for each constraint for each region in the solution

    This approximation step is justified in that it will find equality between 2 constraints if the L2 norm of the difference is below 10E-12

    Then the positive and negative versions of these constraints [ -x < -1, x < 1 are on different sides of the same hyperplane] are made into a format that can be hashed (tuples of ints)

    With this is is relatively strait forward to check for uniqueness with the set

    The first loop scans thru all of the constraints and if the constraint contains a unique hyperplane

    1) if it is a unique hyper plane store the index, add the integer representation to the set, then index the integer representation to the index

    2) if it is not a unique hyperplane do nothing

    The second loop scans thru the constraints again and assigns them unique hyper plane indices and the parity(what side of the hyper plane that they are on)
