# Known limitations

The following are known limitations:

* Raspberry Pi is not available, since it is arm-based and there are no pre-built libraries for PySide
* Ubuntu 20.04 is the version used for testing, it may work with other versions

# Note to Devs

Please keep code as simple as possible. PyQT has a tendency to get complicated.
