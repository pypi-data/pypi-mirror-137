Purpose
-------
When applications that employ `Boto3 <https://boto3.readthedocs.io>`_ must work with AWS resources that are spread across multiple accounts, it can be useful to tie AWS configuration information (both `credentials <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>`_ and `non-credentials <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html>`_) directly to associated AWS resources (*e.g.*, by including the configuration data within URIs). This library provides a class that extracts AWS configuration data and method parameters from a URI, offering a succinct syntax for passing (directly into Boto3 methods) configuration data and/or resource names that are included within URIs.

Package Installation and Usage
------------------------------
The package is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/b3u/>`_::

    python -m pip install b3u

The b3u class can be imported with::

    from b3u import b3u

Examples
^^^^^^^^
The class provides methods for extracting configuration data (credentials and non-credentials) from URIs. The example below illustrates the creation of an S3 client object from a given a URI (for an S3 bucket), where the URI includes credentials (an access key ``ABC``, a secret key ``XYZ``, and a session token ``UVW``)::

    >>> import boto3
    >>> from b3u import b3u
    >>> b = b3u("s3://ABC:XYZ:UVW@example-bucket")
    >>> boto3.client('s3', **b.cred())

The example below creates an S3 client given a URI (for an object in an S3 bucket) where the URI includes credentials (an access key ``ABC`` and a secret key ``XYZ``). The same URI is then used to retrieve a handle for the object itself::

    >>> b = b3u("s3://ABC:XYZ@example-bucket/object.data")
    >>> c = boto3.client(**b.for_client())
    >>> o = c.get_object(**b.for_get())

The example below creates an SSM client given a URI (naming a particular a parameter in the Parameter Store) that specifies the AWS Region ``us-east-1``::

    >>> b = b3u("ssm://ABC:XYZ@/path/to/parameter?region_name=us-east-1")
    >>> boto3.client('ssm', **b.conf())

The example below creates an SSM client given a URI that contains no credentials but does specify an AWS Region. Since no credentials are present in the URI, the `Boto3 Python library <https://boto3.readthedocs.io>`_ will look for them in other locations in the manner specified in the Boto3 documentation)::

    >>> b = b3u("ssm:///path/to/parameter?region_name=us-east-1")
    >>> boto3.client('ssm', **b.conf())

Developer Notes
---------------

Pipenv is used for dependency management of the main library, minus Read the Docs which does not support Pipenv.
You can install all dependencies with::

    pipenv install --dev

To release a new version of the library, run::

    pipenv run python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
    pipenv run python -m build
    pipenv run twine upload dist/*

Documentation
-------------

The documentation can be generated automatically from the source files using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_::

    python -m pip install -e .
    cd docs
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    sphinx-apidoc -f -E --templatedir=_templates -o _source .. && make html

Testing and Conventions
-----------------------
All unit tests are executed and their coverage is measured when using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/contents.html>`_ (see ``setup.cfg`` for configuration details)::

    pipenv run python -m pytest --cov=b3u --cov-report term-missing

Alternatively, all unit tests are included in the module itself and can be executed using doctest:

    pipenv run python src/b3u/b3u.py -v

Style conventions are enforced using `Flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_::

    pipenv run python -m flake8 src/ tests/
