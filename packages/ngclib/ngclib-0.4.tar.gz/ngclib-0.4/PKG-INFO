Description: # Neural Graph Consensus library (ngclib)
        
        This is a library containing the implementation of various basic block [nodes](ngclib/nodes/README.md), [models](ngclib/models/README.md) and [consensus algorithms](ngclib/voting_algorithms/README.md) used by various implementations of ngc consensus projects.
