**_Known Issues_** section at the bottom for important issues that fell victim to our
deadlines and will be solved at a later date.

# BSB: A scaffold modelling framework
This package is intended to facilitate spatially, topologically and morphologically
detailed simulations of brain regions developed by the Department of Brain and
Behavioral Sciences at the University of Pavia.

## Installation

The BSB requires Python 3.8+.

### pip

This software can be installed as a Python package from PyPI through pip:

```
pip install bsb
```

### Developers

Developers best use pip's *editable* install. This creates a live link between the
installed package and the local git repository:

```
 git clone git@github.com:dbbs-lab/bsb
 cd bsb
 pip install -e .[dev]
 pre-commit install
```

## Usage

The scaffold framework is best used in a project context. Create a working directory for
each of your modelling projects and use the command line to configure, reconstruct or
simulate your models.

### Creating a project

You can create boilerplate projects using:

```
bsb new
```

It will ask you some information about the project, like a name and configuration template
and set up the most suited directory structure and key files for you. Afterwards, `cd`
into your project folder:

```
cd my_model
```

### Reconstructing a network

You can use your project to create reconstructions of your model, generating cell positions
and connections:

```
bsb compile -p
```

This should create a network file and plot the network.

### Simulating a network

The default project currently contains no simulation config.

# Known issues

## If MPI is used but mpi4py is not installed, undefined behavior may occur

The BSB determines the amount of NEST virtual processes by using mpi4py to get the amount
of MPI processes. But if the package is not installed it is assumed no MPI simulations
will be ran and the amount of virtual processes might be lower than expected when used in
combination with OpenMP. Be sure to `pip install` using the `[MPI]` requirement tag.

## Topology module scripting requires workarounds

If you're using the topology module to define regions and partitions from scripts you
cannot use the child class constructors but have to use the root `Region` and `Partition`
constructors with a `cls` kwarg and you will have to update the `_partitions` variable
manually for regions:

```python
from bsb.topology import Region, Partition

r = Region(cls="group", partitions=[])
r._partitions = []
p = Partition(cls="layer", region=r)
r._partitions.append(p)
```

Everything works fine from the config though so we recommend defining the topology in a
config file while we work on a fix!
