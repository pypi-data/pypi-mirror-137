  Invalid USER KEY (sign.dice.key).

  Possible causes:
  a. old DICE/CO2MPAS user using a new JET encryption key for the first time;
  b. lost user signature key;
  c. changed computer.

  Solution:

    1a. (for old DICE/CO2MPAS user) search for the user signature key (i.e.,
        'sign.co2mpas.key') inside the CO2MPAS DICE KEYS folder (i.e.,
        C:/Users/"username‚Äù folder);
    1b. (you lost your user signature key) generate a new user signature key and
        contact us;
    2. encrypt JET input file using the user signature key mentioned above.
