# canadacovidmetrics

This is a Python package that provides key metrics regarding COVID-19 situation in Canada across provinces using the [OpenCovid API](https://opencovid.ca/api/).

## Summary

This package allows users to obtain key metrics on COVID-19 situation in Canada at national or provincial level for a specific time period. The 4 functions will return key metrics, including total cumulative cases, total cumulative deaths, total cumulative recovered cases and total cumulative vaccine completion, using data from [OpenCovid API](https://opencovid.ca/api/). The users may use the key metrics to conduct further analyses on COVID-19 situation in Canada.

## Functions

There are 4 functions in this package:

-   `get_cases` Query total cumulative cases with ability to specify province and date range of returned data.

-   `get_deaths` Query total cumulative deaths with ability to specify province and date range of returned data.

-   `get_recoveries` Query total cumulative recovered cases with ability to specify province and date range of returned data.

-   `get_vaccinations` Query total cumulative vaccine completion with ability to specify province and date range of returned data.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install canadacovidmetrics
```

## Usage & Examples

### Total number of deaths over past week by province

```python
from canadacovidmetrics import canadacovidmetrics as ccm
import datetime as dt
deaths_last_week = ccm.get_deaths(after=str(dt.date.today() - dt.timedelta(days=7)))
deaths_last_week.groupby('province').sum('deaths').plot.barh(y='deaths', title='Deaths by province in past week');
```

### National vaccination completion in 2021

```python
from canadacovidmetrics import canadacovidmetrics as ccm
vaccines_2021 = ccm.get_vaccinations(loc='canada', after='2021-01-01', before='2021-12-31')
vaccines_2021.plot('date_vaccine_completed', 'cumulative_cvaccine', title='Cumulative national vaccinations');
```

### Daily new case count by province

```python
from canadacovidmetrics import canadacovidmetrics as ccm
cases_data = ccm.get_cases().set_index('date_report')
cases_data.groupby('province')['cases'].plot(legend=True, figsize=(10,6), title='Number of reported cases by day by province');
```

## Python ecosystem

There are several packages for easy access to COVID-19 key metrics or data using different APIs, examples include
- [covid](https://github.com/nf1s/covid) using [John Hopkins University API](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/about/)
- [COVID19Py](https://github.com/Kamaropoulos/COVID19Py) using [Coronavirus Tracker API](https://github.com/ExpDev07/coronavirus-tracker-api)
- [covid19pyclient](https://github.com/NiklasTiede/covid19pyclient) using [RKI API](https://github.com/marlon360/rki-covid-api)

To our knowledge, there is no similar package using [OpenCovid API](https://opencovid.ca/api/) in the Python ecosystem.
