# Proximal Augmented Lagrangian method for Quadratic Programs

QPALM is a numerical optimization package that finds stationary points of (possibly **nonconvex**) quadratic programs, that is 
```
minimize        ½ xᵀQx + qᵀx

subject to      l ≤ Ax ≤ u
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be found at: <https://tttapa.github.io/QPALM-minimal/Doxygen>  
Examples are included as well: <https://tttapa.github.io/QPALM-minimal/Doxygen/examples.html>

## Installation

To install the Python interface to QPALM, you can download pre-built binaries
from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qpalm/):
```sh
python3 -m pip install qpalm
```

To install the Matlab interface, download `qpalm-matlab.tar.gz` from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/tttapa/QPALM-minimal/releases/latest), and 
extract it into the `~/Documents/MATLAB` folder. As a one-liner:
```sh
wget https://github.com/tttapa/QPALM-minimal/releases/download/0.0.0a2/qpalm-matlab.tar.gz -O- | tar xz -C ~/Documents/MATLAB
```
