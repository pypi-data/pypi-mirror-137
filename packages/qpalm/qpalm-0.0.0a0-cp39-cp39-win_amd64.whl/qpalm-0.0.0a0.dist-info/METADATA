# Proximal Augmented Lagrangian method for Quadratic Programs

QPALM is a numerical optimization package that finds stationary points of (possibly **nonconvex**) quadratic programs, that is 
```
minimize        0.5 x' Q x + q' x

subject to      l <= A x <= u
```

## Documentation

You can now find the the documentation [here](https://tttapa.github.io/QPALM-minimal/). This includes all information you need to get started using QPALM.
