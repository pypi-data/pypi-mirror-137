When the module was made, I was 17 and it was made for personnal uses and learning reasons so be indulgent.

In this module, you will be able to:\n
-preprocess data\n
-create MLPs\n
-visualize the evolution of the learning model\n
-retrieve all the data if needed (including all hyper parameters)
