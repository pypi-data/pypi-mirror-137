# Example of loading data from account

Deployed by [tncli](https://github.com/disintar/tncli)

This is an example that shows developers that any information stored in a smart contract can be parsed. Here I take out
the seqno of my wallet in testnet

Also that means you can take ANY account state and create own code on top of it.

### Usage

- `tncli lc saveaccountdata ./build/boc/c4.boc EQB36_EfYjFYMV8p_cxSYX61bA0FZ4B65ZNN6L8INY-5gL6w` save account data
- `tncli run fift/load_c4.fif --build` build func and run load_c4.fif

You can use any wallet smart contract address instead of `EQB36_EfYjFYMV8p_cxSYX61bA0FZ4B65ZNN6L8INY-5gL6w`
