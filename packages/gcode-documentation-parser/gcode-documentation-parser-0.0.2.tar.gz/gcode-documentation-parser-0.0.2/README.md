==

See a [demo] usage of the output

A utility that parses the documentation pages from Marlin, RepRap, and Klipper,
to generate an index of commands usage.

Normally, the output would be used by something like [gcode-documentation], to
allow users to search and understand how a GCode command should be used.

This was originally created in [Octoprint] plugin [MarlinGcodeDocumentation],
and needs the parsed documentation data to function.
